## Project title
WellnessWave Workout App

## What and why?
I am developing a fitness application designed to empower users in their fitness journey, emphasizing both accountability and the sharing of achievements. With the fitness landscape cluttered with fleeting trends and enduring myths, it becomes increasingly challenging for individuals to discern effective strategies for their personal fitness goals.  Additionally, there is a concerning trend of individuals cultivating unhealthy perceptions of body image, often exacerbated by intense gym routines.  Our platform is committed to fostering self-acceptance and a balanced lifestyle, all while providing straightforward, scientifically-backed gym advice.  We aim to be a beacon of reliable information and positive support in the fitness world.

## For whom?
Our app is designed for anyone engaged in fitness who seeks a reliable way to monitor their progress. 

## How?
1. Firstly, in the development of our app, we will focus on UI design. We plan to categorize exercises based on body parts, and then provide examples of workouts for each muscle within those body parts.

2. The core functions of the app include adding, deleting, modifying, and viewing exercises. Users can select exercises to add to their personal list. Once added, they can adjust the number of repetitions for each exercise, delete it, or add different exercises. Users also have the option to create custom exercises. Finally, the app provides a daily summary, informing users of the exercises they completed, the number of repetitions, and their ongoing commitment over time.

3. For another feature, we will introduce a feature that allows different users to form groups. Within each group, a designated leader (similar to a coach) will assign specific exercises and repetitions to individual members. Additionally, the leader will have the capability to monitor the completion status of all group members.

## Scope:
This proposal is not too easy for a group of 4 to complete since there will be an adequate number of features to implement.

The WellnessWave Workout App project aims to create a comprehensive fitness platform, focusing on user-friendly UI design, personal workout management, and community engagement.  Key deliverables include an intuitive interface for categorizing exercises, functionalities for users to tailor their workout routines, automated daily progress summaries, and a group feature for community building and leader-assigned workouts.  

First of all, we need to focus on UI design. Then, we can divide the tasks according to the functionalities. The technical requirements encompass a robust database, scalable web architecture, multimedia integration, and a content moderation system.
